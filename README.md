# Run the API & DB with Docker

- First thing is to make sure [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/) is correctly installed and [Docker compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/) is correctly set up.
- After cloning the project, you may start the app with the following command: `docker compose up`

The app should be running just fine on port `3000` and the postgres server will be visible on your machine with the following info:
`user: postgres`
`password: postgres`
`port: 5432`
